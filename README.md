# ML-from-scratch
<h2>In this Repository, I shall be implementing ML Algorithm from scratch! </h2>

<p>When I say scratch - I mean I have used nothing but basic packages, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Idea is not to compete this programs with state of the art implementation from famous libraries like Scikit-learn etc., but impelementation gives holistic know-how of the full algoithm </p>
<p> All the implementation shall original approach </p>
<p> There are some scopes to improve the runtime/ spacetime complexities. However, the intention is to build a working model</p>

<h3> What do you have it here? </h3>
<li> If you are wrapping your head around the ML algorithms for the first time and looking for some non-standard implementation</li>
<li> If you are looking for some codebase to start building something from scratch! This repo could be a good place to begin.</li>

<h4> ** Initial KNN (K- Nearest Neighbour) algorithm is added, I will keep pushing as I build. Happy Coding :) <h4>
